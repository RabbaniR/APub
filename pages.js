    "\t Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing \n to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or \n conversations?'\n\t So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel \n very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble \n of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by \n her.\n\t There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way \n to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over \n afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed \n quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at \n it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never \n before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with \n curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large \n rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\t In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was \n to get out again. \n\t The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so \n suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself \n falling down a very deep well.\n",
    "\t Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went \n down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down \n and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the \n sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there \n she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: \n she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the \n cupboards as she fell past it. \n\t 'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down \n stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell \n off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely true.) \n\t Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! 'I wonder how many miles I've fallen \n by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: \n that would be four thousand miles down, I think—' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of \n this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for \n showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it \n over) '—yes, that's about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got \n to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand \n words to say.) \n\t Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it'll seem \n to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—' \n (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) \n '—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this \n New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you're \n falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an ignorant little girl she'll \n think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'\n",
    "\t Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. 'Dinah'll \n miss me very much to-night, I should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her \n saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice \n in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats \n eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a \n dreamy sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do bats eat cats?' for, you \n see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that \n she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, \n and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?' when \n suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was \n over. \n\t Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was \n all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, \n hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just \n in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She \n was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found \n herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof. \n\t There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the \n way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, \n wondering how she was ever to get out again. \n\t Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on \n it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of \n the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would \n not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had \n not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little \n golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n",
    "\t Tweedledee smiled gently, and began again: \n 'The sun was shining on the sea, \n Shining with all his might: \n He did his very best to make \n The billows smooth and bright— \n And this was odd, because it was \n The middle of the night. \n The moon was shining sulkily, \n Because she thought the sun \n Had got no business to be there \n After the day was done— \n 'It's very rude of him,' she said, \n 'To come and spoil the fun!' \n   The sea was wet as wet could be, \n The sands were dry as dry. \n You could not see a cloud, because \n No cloud was in the sky: \n No birds were flying over head— \n There were no birds to fly. \n The Walrus and the Carpenter \n Were walking close at hand; \n They wept like anything to see \n Such quantities of sand: \n 'If this were only cleared away,' \n They said, 'it would be grand!' \n ",
    " 'O Oysters, come and walk with us!' \n The Walrus did beseech. \n 'A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk, \n Along the briny beach: \n We cannot do with more than four, \n To give a hand to each.' \n The eldest Oyster looked at him. \n But never a word he said: \n The eldest Oyster winked his eye, \n And shook his heavy head— \n Meaning to say he did not choose \n To leave the oyster-bed. \n But four young oysters hurried up, \n All eager for the treat: \n Their coats were brushed, their faces washed, \n Their shoes were clean and neat— \n And this was odd, because, you know, \n They hadn't any feet. \n    Four other Oysters followed them, \n And yet another four; \n And thick and fast they came at last, \n  And more, and more, and more— \n All hopping through the frothy waves, \n And scrambling to the shore. \n The Walrus and the Carpenter \n Walked on a mile or so, \n And then they rested on a rock \n Conveniently low: \n And all the little Oysters stood \n And waited in a row.",
